            I am Elvin Mark Munoz Vega, but please just call me Elvin ðŸ˜‚. I am
            interested in anything related with Machine Learning ðŸ§ ðŸ’», specially
            in Deep Learning. Though, I have a particular interest on Comptuer
            Vision ðŸ‘€. I really find fascinating how Deep Neural Networks can
            recognize different kind of images , detect objects within an image
            with astonishing accuracy or even generate images that can trick
            anybody into beliving that is a real thing. I think there is still a
            lot to research about in this field and I would like to be part of
            that evolution.
